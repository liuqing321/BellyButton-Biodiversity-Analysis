# BellyButton-Biodiversity-Analysis


## Purpose of Analysis 

The project is for visualizing the bacteria data for each volunteer. We are going to create a bar chart, a bubble chart and a gauge chart on web page. And those charts will update automatically while we change the test subject ID in the dropdown list. 

The bubble chart will illustrate the value for each type of bacteria on each sample. And the bar chart will rank the top 10 bacteria found on each sample. The gauge chart will show you the frequency of washing belly button for each volunteer. Those charts will help the researchers to find out the relationship between the biodiversity on human skin and the frequency of washing/clean.
